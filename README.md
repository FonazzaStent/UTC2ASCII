# UTC2ASCII
Convert Unicode text to ASCII
The program will convert text containing Unicode characters and formatting to plain ASCII text. Copy the text you want to convert from the text source (i.e. a website), paste it to the text window, click "Convert" to convert to ASCII, click "Copy" to copy text to clipboard. The Windows executalbe works with no additional modules, but you will have to bypass file safety controls. The Python script requires Python to work, plus two additional modules, unidecode and pyperclip. To install these modules open a Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following commands:

pip install unidecode
pip install pyperclip
